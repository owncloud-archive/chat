Near(er) future:
 - Offline messages
 - Voice/Video communication via WebRTC
 - Design workover (maybe reuse [Kondou's chatapp design](https://github.com/Kondou-ger/oc_chat)
 - Something to notify the user, that he got a message, while he's in a different app, than the chatapp
 - Fix [CSP issues](https://github.com/owncloud/chat/issues/10) and thus (maybe) make port-opening uneccessary
 - Use the built-in appframework (as soon as it's stable enough)
 - Work around having to start up a websocket server as a php file (not possible in e.g. shared-hosting)
 - Use angular.js

Far future:
 - Mobile apps
 - Integration with IRC/XMPP/other ownCloud instances/…
